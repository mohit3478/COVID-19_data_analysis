# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project is a data analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using Python. The analysis is conducted in the `covid_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which uses the `covid_Data.csv` dataset. The primary goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the spread and impact of the virus across different regions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Analyses & Visualizations

The Jupyter Notebook explores the dataset to answer key questions about the pandemic. The analysis likely includes:

* **Global Totals:** Calculating the total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide.
* **Country-wise Comparison:** Analyzing and ranking countries based on their total number of cases, deaths, and recovery rates.
* **Trend Analysis:** Plotting time-series data to visualize the growth of confirmed cases and deaths over time.
* **Active Cases:** Calculating and visualizing the number of active cases (Confirmed - Deaths - Recovered) to see the ongoing burden on healthcare systems.
